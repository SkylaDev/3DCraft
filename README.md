# 3D Craft

### By SkylaDev <b>:3</b>

A small project that I have spent the last few years thinking about doing but never actually finding time to work on, 3D craft is a Minecraft resource pack that aims to make blocks more 3D like while keeping the traditional 16 pixel look of the game.

All models are designed to give a new 3D look to the game while trying to keep the FPS count as happy as it can be, even while using shaders.
